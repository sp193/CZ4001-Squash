# CZ4001-Squash
CZ4001 Virtual and Augmented Reality

Tentative functional requirements:
*Enhanced version of the classic squash game.
*Player scores points for hitting the ball against the wall.
*Targets will randomly spawn on the wall.
*Bonus points will be awarded if the targets are hit.
*The game ends when the ball either comes to a stop or bounces off the ground twice.
*Player can move around the play area by walking, but this will not require a lot of movement.

Scoring:
*Each bounce off the wall will award the user 1 point.
*Each hit target will award the user 10 points.

Additional instructions for setting up the source code:
*Add the custom merge rules from .gitconfig with this command: git config --local include.path .gitconfig
